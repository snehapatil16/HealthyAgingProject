# Whole Person Health Aging Data Analysis

The Whole Person Health Aging Data Analysis project is designed to analyze and cluster data related to healthy aging. This demonstrates the code that my software development team created for our client in order to categorize and illustrate the most important activities within a dataset.

The user manual provides instructions on how to use the project effectively, including installation, setup, and a step-by-step guide on performing data import, clustering, and viewing results.
